# Subnetting
Used network subnetting concepts and build a small cisco packet tracer project.
An IP is provided 200.10.10.0/24. 
The task was to do subnetting and create 6 new networks for inter routing connection through cloud using sub-interfaces.
There are 3 routers having 2 sub-interface each with two different networks.
Each router is conected to 3 PCs via switch having different network.
Used RIP(Routing Information Protocol), an interior gateway protocol (IGP) that uses a distance-vector algorithm to determine the best route for data packets to travel through a network.
