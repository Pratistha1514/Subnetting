# Subnetting
# Cisco Packet Tracer Subnetting & RIP Routing Project
Designed and simulated a routed network in Cisco Packet Tracer using IP range 200.10.10.0/24, divided into 6 subnets for efficient inter-router communication.

-Configured 3 routers, each with 2 sub-interfaces, connected through a cloud router using serial connections.

-Each router connected to a switch with 3 PCs, each on a separate subnet (e.g., 200.10.10.96, 200.10.10.128, 200.10.10.160).

-Implemented RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for dynamic route sharing across subnets using a distance-vector algorithm.

-Applied networking concepts including subnetting, VLSM, and switch/router configuration.
